        <h3>MIT App Inventor: Paint Pot</h3>
        <h5>September 2017 to October 2017, Computer Science//Software</h5>
        <p>The objective of this project was to get familiar with <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">App Inventor</a> and how it works. My partner and I took on the role of coder. We both had made an app with similar ideas. These ideas became part of the final version of the game. Through the project, I learned how to make a share feature in an app. I also learned how to save a drawing to the deviceâ€™s storage. My partner and I encountered a few challenges of our own. A challenge was figuring out the layout of the features. We both had very different locations for some of the features in the app. In the end, we compromised a place for the features to go. My partner and I got along well and got a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wfz6ZMU6gUYuBKOPbIQ9qQtfNuOjzAsGTHJdqGx0tBI/edit">good score</a> on this project as well.</p>
