          <p class="col-sm-8" class="pull left">The objective of this project was to get familiar with <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">App Inventor</a> and how it works.
          My partner and I took on the role of coder. We both had made an app with similar ideas. These ideas became part of the final version of the game. 
          Through the project, I learned how to make a share feature in an app. I also learned how to save a drawing to the device’s storage. My partner and I encountered 
          a few challenges of our own. A challenge was figuring out the layout of the features. We both had very different locations for some of the features in the app. 
          In the end, we compromised a place for the features to go. My partner and I got along well and got a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wfz6ZMU6gUYuBKOPbIQ9qQtfNuOjzAsGTHJdqGx0tBI/edit">good score</a> 
          on this project as well.</p>

          <p class="col-sm-8" class="pull left">The objective of this project was to get more familiar with using Python and how it functions. 
          My partner and I coded the project. We used a program called Cloud9 for this project. The project <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nMqH-R9JE_lgE0ZbBZy3OLaFw9e1TcXvQjJKqSixy1E/edit">required</a>
          an adventure with multiple endings. The theme of the project that my partner and I chose was Aladdin. 
          Through the project, I learned how to use Python and how to properly make functions. I also learned how to make a proper flowchart. 
          We made one for this project (click <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OfaF1FDXH1CMm0UqyLIBSsDSkZta3kde/view">here</a> to see the flowchart).
          A challenge that we faced was that the code wouldn’t appear in the bash terminal. With help from our teacher we got the code to work. 
          Overall, the group’s cooperation was good.</p>
